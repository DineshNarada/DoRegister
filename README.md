## Installation

1. **Download the plugin**
   - Download the `DoRegister` folder to your WordPress plugins directory

2. **Activate the plugin**
   - Go to WordPress Admin > Plugins
   - Find "DoRegister - Registration System"
   - Click "Activate"

3. **Configure shortcodes**
   - Add shortcodes to your pages/posts as needed

## Usage

### Shortcodes

Add these shortcodes to any page or post to display the respective forms:

#### Account Page (Recommended)
```
[doregister_account]
```
Displays a unified account page with:
- **For logged-out users**: Tabbed interface with Login and Register options
- **For logged-in users**: Profile information and logout button
- **Manual menu control**: Create a page with this shortcode and link it to your navigation menu

#### Registration Form
```
[doregister_form]
```
Displays the complete 5-step registration form.

#### Login Form
```
[doregister_login]
```
Displays the custom login form.

#### User Profile
```
[doregister_profile]
```
Displays the user profile (requires user to be logged in). The profile page now includes a frontend **edit form** and **delete account** flow so subscribers can update email, password, profile photo and other meta fields without using the WP admin.

### Setting Up the Account Page (Recommended Method)

1. **Create a WordPress Page**
   - Go to **WordPress Admin > Pages > Add New**
   - Title: "Account" (or "My Account", "Login", etc.)
   - Add the shortcode: `[doregister_account]`
   - Publish the page

2. **Add to Navigation Menu**
   - Go to **Appearance > Menus**
   - Add your new Account page to the menu
   - Set the menu item text to "Account" or "My Account"
   - Assign the menu to your theme's primary navigation location
   - Save the menu

3. **Result**: Users can now click "Account" in your navigation to access login/register/profile functionality on a dedicated page.

### Admin Interface

Access the admin interface:
- Go to **Users > DoRegister Users**
- View and manage all registered users
- Edit user meta fields
- View profile photos

## Requirements

- **WordPress**: 5.0 or higher
- **PHP**: 7.2 or higher
